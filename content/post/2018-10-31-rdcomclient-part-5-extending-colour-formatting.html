<p>In my last post I introduced creating a new Excel workbook, writing data into that workbook, and applying some formatting to that data. In this post I’ll cover the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simplifying the colour specification</li>
<li>Saving your workbook</li>
</ul>
<div id="simplifying-colour-specification" class="section level2">
<h2>Simplifying colour specification</h2>
<p>As we saw in the previous post, it is a bit difficult telling Excel what colour to use for something. You need to know the exact numeric reference for a colour and unless you have identified the colour through trial and error previously, it’s just not something you want to be doing.</p>
<p>Luckily for us this problem has been largely solved already. We will need to introduce another package here called <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/gplots/versions/3.0.1">gplots</a>. This package includes a function called <code>col2hex</code>. This function takes a colour string like “red”, and outputs the respective hexadecimal code.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/~frazier/RSpatialGuides/colorPaletteCheatsheet.pdf">this link</a>, R has 657 built-in colour names. We can just pass the desired colour name to the <code>col2hex</code> function and get our hex code back.</p>
<p>About now some of you are probably asking what good is a hexadecimal code since we can’t pass it directly to Excel. Excellent question, well presented! When I first started playing around with this problem, I found the <code>strtoi</code> function from base R that converts strings to integers with a specified base. I thought I could just pass the hex code to this function and I’d easily get a number back. Well as it happens, you do get a number back - it’s just not the right number if you pass the whole hex code to the function.</p>
<p>Here’s what I tried first. I’ll assume that you’ve got your Excel document open using the method we used in the previous post.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>suppressMessages(library(gplots))
library(stringr)

# try converting a known colour to a hexadecimal value
col2hex(&#39;red&#39;) # should give &quot;#FF0000&quot;</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;#FF0000&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># try converting that hexadecimal string to a decimal number
strtoi(&quot;FF0000&quot;) </code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] NA</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># that didn&#39;t work because we didn&#39;t specify the base
strtoi(&quot;FF0000&quot;, base = 16) </code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 16711680</code></pre>
<p>Since I knew that the colour red is represented by the hex code “#FF0000” I expected to see the strtoi() function return a value of 255, since I also knew that this is the number that red should correspond to. Clearly 16711680 was not going to give me the result I wanted. After a few hours looking around online I found <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8468855/convert-a-rgb-colour-value-to-decimal">this post</a> that described how the hex codes represent the red, green and blue channels of a colour.</p>
<p>After finding that little gem, I just wrote a simple little function that takes a colour name as the argument. This function converts that string to a hexadecimal code, converts the respective colour channels to decimal numbers, and then combines them in the necessary way to arrive at a decimal number we can pass to Excel through the <code>[[&quot;Color&quot;]]</code> property.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># create our function that will be used to calculate the decimal
# representation of a colour
colNum &lt;- function(colour = &quot;black&quot;){
  
  # catch error if a value other than a recognised colour is entered
  if(!(colour %in% colours())){
    stop(&quot;Please enter one of the R specified colours as a string.\n
         The R colours can be found by typing colours().&quot;)
  }
  
  # first convert colour to hexadecimal code and strip out the hashtag
  value &lt;- col2hex(colour) %&gt;%
    str_replace(&quot;#&quot;, &quot;&quot;)
  
  # get the component colours
  R &lt;- str_sub(value, 1, 2) %&gt;% strtoi(base = 16)
  
  G &lt;- str_sub(value, 3, 4) %&gt;% strtoi(base = 16)
  
  B &lt;- str_sub(value, 5, 6) %&gt;% strtoi(base = 16)
  
  # calculate the decimal resultant of the three colour channels
  colour &lt;- B * 65536 + G * 256 + R
  
  return(colour)
}

# now we can specify the colour of text in our target cell simply by 
# passing a colour name to our function
dataCellFont[[&quot;Color&quot;]] &lt;- colNum(&quot;magenta1&quot;)

dataCellFont[[&quot;Color&quot;]] &lt;- colNum(&quot;springgreen2&quot;)

dataCellFont[[&quot;Color&quot;]] &lt;- colNum(&quot;red&quot;)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="saving-your-workbook" class="section level2">
<h2>Saving your workbook</h2>
<p>Now that you’ve gone through all the effort to create your “Hello World!” document, you’ll be wanting to save it so you can keep it.</p>
<p>This is a simple matter of using the SaveAs method on the workbook object. Be sure to specify where you want to save your document by passing a path string as an argument. If you don’t provide a path, the document will save in your current working directory. In order to make sure your document saves smoothly, you can include the command <code>ex[[&quot;DisplayAlerts&quot;]] &lt;- FALSE</code> before you save your document. This will prevent a popup message asking if you want to replace your document. It is important to remember to restore your DisplayAlerts property to TRUE at the end of your script.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ex[[&quot;DisplayAlerts&quot;]] &lt;- FALSE
current_file$SaveAs(&quot;D:\\notpeerreviewed\\data\\hello_world.xlsx&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] TRUE</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># close the current document
current_file$Close(SaveChanges = TRUE)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] TRUE</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>ex[[&quot;DisplayAlerts&quot;]] &lt;- TRUE

# now we can quit Excel
ex$Quit()</code></pre>
<pre><code>## NULL</code></pre>
<p>This post has been a bit more about understanding the underlying workings of how R deals with colours and how different colour codes work. In my next post I’ll show how to write a more realistic example of data into a workbook.</p>
