      <description>I’ve recently been more involved with mapping projects at work and I was asked by a colleague to update an older product as some of the boundary information had changed in a particular region. I’ve been taking every opportunity to use R for my mapping and geospatial work if at all possible so I immediately thought I’d give it a go with this project too. I thought it’d be just another quick job and then back to what I was doing before.</description>
