      <description>This is the first of what will become a series on how to use RDCOMClient. I am writing this blog series so I can share what I’ve learned, and so I have everything located in a single place for future reference. I don’t claim to be an expert, so if I say something that is clearly incorrect then please let me know so I can make corrections.
RDCOMClient is an R package written by Duncan Temple Lang.</description>
