      <description>This is the first of what will become a series on how to use RDCOMClient. I am writing this blog series so I can share what I’ve learned, and so I have everything located in a single place for future reference. I don’t claim to be an expert, so if I say something that is clearly incorrect then please let me know so I can make corrections.
RDCOMClient is an R package written by Duncan Temple Lang.</description>

      <description>A first postA few years ago I changed careers to indulge an interest in data science. I’ve been working in this field for almost 3 years now and, for the most part, I’ve loved it. I get to play with coding every day, statistics and mathematics fairly often, and I’ve even had the opportunity to tinker with some Javascript for data visualisation. The best (and worst!) thing about it is that I have a list of things I want to learn that is very long, and it just keeps growing.</description>
