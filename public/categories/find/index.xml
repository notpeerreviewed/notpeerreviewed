      <description>In my last post I looked at how to use the UsedRange() method to create a range from which we could read the Values. In this post weâ€™ll look at how we can reduce the size of the range by choosing only the parts of range we know we need.
If you know that there is a cell within your data that always carries the same value, you can use that as a key reference when building a range object.</description>
