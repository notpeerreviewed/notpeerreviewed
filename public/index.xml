      <description>For years I have been saying to myself - “I really should start a blog”. Recently I stumbled across the blogdown package and finally decided I had a simple enough tool to help me get started.
One Saturday night later and I am up and running with a functional blog. Fast forward a few months and here we are. I’ve decided that the best topic for me to write about first is the RDCOMClient package.</description>

      <description>A first postA few years ago I changed careers to indulge an interest in data science. I’ve been working in this field for almost 3 years now and, for the most part, I’ve loved it. I get to play with coding every day, statistics and mathematics fairly often, and I’ve even had the opportunity to tinker with some Javascript for data visualisation. The best (and worst!) thing about it is that I have a list of things I want to learn that is very long, and it just keeps growing.</description>
